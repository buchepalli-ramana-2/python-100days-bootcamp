## FOR LOOPs
#### Description
- A ```for``` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
  ```for``` loop works on ```List``` of items
- ```python
    for item in list_of_items:
        #Do something for each item.
    ```
## Range function
- The ```range()``` function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.
