## Function
- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
- functions are used to reusable code.

```python
# Defintion of the function

def function_name():
    #Do this task
    #Then execute this code
    #Finally do this

# Calling the function
 function_name()

```
- There are some python [built in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

## Indentation
- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
- For indetation we can use 4 ```Spaces``` or single ```Tab``` sapce
- Official document reference for [style guide for python code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#code-lay-out)

## While Loop
- With the ```while``` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
```python
while condition_is_true:
    #do this task
```
